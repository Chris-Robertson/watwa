## WATWA, A Terminal Weather App

This simple little Ruby app was made as a part of a challenge while studying at
Coder Factory Academy.

It displays the next 10 day's maximum temperature forecast for central
Melbourne. Nothing more, nothing less.

I found that I was actually using it to give me a quick overview of the weather
over the coming week, so I published the gem.

There are quite a few changes I would like to make to it (who still uses
Fahrenheit anyway?) and maybe I will get around to them at some stage.
